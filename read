# Forked Repository Practice

## Description
This repository was forked as a part of college assignment to practise git and github workflows.
The task performed include working the repository, cloning it to the local system, adding a new file with content and creating a '.gitignore' file to manage the untracked files effectively.
## Steps:
1. **Forked a repository**:
   - forked the repository using the 'Fork' button on github to create a copy under my github account.
2. **cloned the repository**:
   - used the following command to clone the forked repository in the local system:
       git clone <url-of-the-repository>
3. **Made changes locally**:
   - created a file using the following command : touch <file-name>.
   - added some content in it using the command : echo "<the content>" > "file-name".
   - staged the changes to be commited using the command : git add.
   - commited the changes : git commit -m"commit message"
   - and at the end push the changes to the remote repository using command : git push origin master
4. **Created a Pull Request** :
   - Navigated to my forked repository on github.
   - Opened the 'Pull Requests" tab and clicked "New Pull Request".
   - Compared my forked repository with original repository.
   - Added a title and description for the pull request and submitted it for the review.
